- Create a detail view controller. When you select a row in the tableview it should segue to the correct detail view. Don't forget to pass the object to the detail page in the segue.

- Create a back button that segues from the detail view to the tableview.

- App must be dynamically laid out for portrait mode for all devices. Use autolayout.

## Section 2: Bonus
